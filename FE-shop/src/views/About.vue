        <h3>ADIDAS AT A GLANCE</h3>
        <p>adidas has its roots in Germany but we are a truly global company. Around the world we employ over 62,000 people. At our global HQ in Herzogenaurach, Germany, our teams are made up of people from over 100 different nations. These numbers alone can easily suggest that adidas is quite a large and also multifaceted organization. True. But we keep things simple, lean, and fast. And we will use this approach now to give an overview of what our company is all about.</p>

        <h3>OUR PURPOSE: THROUGH SPORT, WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE LIVES</h3>
        <p>Everything we do is rooted in sport. Sport plays an increasingly important role in more and more people’s lives, on and off the field of play. It is central to every culture and society and is core to our health and happiness. Our purpose, ‘through sport, we have the power to change lives’, guides the way we run our company, how we work with our partners, how we create our products, and how we engage with our consumers. We will always strive to expand the limits of human possibilities, to include and unite people in sport, and to create a more sustainable world. </p>

        <h3>OUR MISSION: TO BE THE BEST SPORTS BRAND IN THE WORLD </h3>
        <p>Athletes do not settle for average. And neither do we. We have a clear mission: To be the best sports brand in the world. Every day, we come to work to create and sell the best sports products in the world, and to offer the best service and consumer experience – and to do it all in a sustainable way. We are the best when we are the credible, inclusive, and sustainable leader in our industry. </p>
